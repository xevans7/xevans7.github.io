<p>Hello! Here's a blog post about this movies store project I worked on. It was my first time creating anything web development related, and I had a fun time working on it. I'd say that it ended up as a success.</p>
<p>I'll first run down the main pages on it and their functionality, then take a look at my building process and how that went.</p>

<h3>The Functionality</h3>
<p>To start off, when you visit the <a href="https://xevans06.pythonanywhere.com/">website</a>, you'll first be brought face-to-face with the home screen. It features a little tagline alongside a random movie quote each time you visit. There's also some links above in the header and information below in the footer, and we'll see it follow us to each page.</p>
<p>If we take a look at the 'About' page, we get a short little blurb about the website itself. Then clicking the link right next door, we get the movies page. There's a wide variety of movies (and not movies) available with a search function to pick out certain movies by name.</p>
<p>If we click on a movie, we'll be brought to an informational page, where you can see a description and comments left by users. If you're a registered user, you can even leave your own comments, report offensive ones, or purhcase a movie.</p>
<p>Once you follow the quick-and-easy registration system, you can view the cart of movies you want to buy and check out at any time. Then you can also view any orders you may have placed in the past.</p>
<p>That's just about most of the content the site has, I hope you have a fun time using it.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>To get a glimpse into how the site was made, it took learning from quite a few sources especially with this being a first attempt at web development. Primarily however, learning the Django framework and most big features were applied through the guidance of the book Django 5 for the Impatient - Second Edition.</p>
<p>However, as this project progressed, I got ideas for additions and modifications here and there. While there are simple changes to the flavor text all around the place, those were primarily changes I'd make in congruence with developing features as they came along. This spans the footer text, about me page, and homepage/title.</p>
<p>One spot I found myself coming back to again and again however was the movie selection. I'd occasionally decide to add a few films to the list and incorporate them, always making the descriptions about usually the first thought that comes to mind when I think about it and a comment joking about the film in some way. This even extended to the final film list, as I'd typically add something relatively random, whether something I'm a huge fan of, fake/meme-y movies, or something that I have personal ties to like nostalgia.</p>
<p>But on the side of more meaningful changes, I found a list of a few things I could see myself easily implementing when I had just about concluded the making of the website. This included a random movie quote generator, a GT-themed banner (which was by far the most difficult thing for me to implement personally due to weird screen size/aspect ratio issues), more stylized buttons, GT-colorization, and the report system.</p>
<p>The most significant of these is the reporting system; I made a boolean field to the user reviews determining whether a certain review had or hadn't been reported. It hid all reported reviews from other users, but allowed the admin to discern whether to delete the review or reinstate it to the site, with a filter to easily split reported from unreported reviews.</p>
<p>Overall, my process of writing was a pretty fun one (even though W3 Schools and Mozilla Developer Tools) helped me out more times than I can remember, even when making this portfolio site. I can confidently say after it all however, that I am far more comfortable with using Django and HTML/CSS than I expected to be going into this project.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed my work.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 30px;">PS: I hope some of the text alterations I made to my movies store are still within the bounds of this class. I found them to be a fun way to inject my own bit of personality into my final product, but if you'd consider them inappropriate, please let me know so I can know for the future.</p>
